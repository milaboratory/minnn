One sided barcoding, barcodes introduced using linear PCR (DNA-based library).

This is a paired-end read sample containing first 25000 reads from the project.

The UMI sequence is first 14 bases, sample barcode follows at a certain distance:

```
(UMI:NNNNNNNNNNNNNN)nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn(SB:NNNN)
```

Correct sample barcode is ``SB=GAAC``
