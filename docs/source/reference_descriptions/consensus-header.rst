Consensus actions are used to calculate consensus sequences for all combinations of barcode values. They also allow to
find multiple consensuses in the same combination of barcodes if there are multiple sequences with the same barcodes
in the data.

**Important:** :ref:`sort` action must be used before any consensus action with the same groups in :code:`--groups`
argument as in consensus action, otherwise the results of consensus action will be wrong!
